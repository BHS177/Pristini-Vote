# Logo Setup Instructions

To add your Pristini International School logo:

1. Place your logo image file in the `public` folder
2. Name it `logo.png` (or update the filename in `index.html` line 19)
3. Recommended size: 200x200px to 400x400px
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG

If no logo is found, a beautiful fallback design with the school's "P" emblem will be displayed automatically.

The logo will be automatically styled with:
- Glowing shadow effects
- Hover animations
- Responsive sizing for mobile and desktop
